"Consider your sample bias. I'm sure there are folks in your institution like this, but likely far fewer. I practice in a rural area where the provider to patient ratio is 1:2,300 and so even the clinicians who do care simply don't have the time or ability to handle the zebras well or to afford the bedside manner that better ratios provide. I went to school in DC (GWU) which was a starkly contrasted experience that sounds more like what you're used to.",Yes
"This hospital system is huge. It has many, many hospital campuses throughout the state, none of which are actually affected by the storm, just the community around this specific one. They are not hurting for money. They asked for volunteers to go 3 hours away to help work nights at this hospital. Lodging at the hospital included...meaning a shared conference room or something. (Obviously the hotels are full, that isn't the issue.) But to not offer crisis pay or incentive pay or anything beyond base pay?!?

Maybe I'm just really selfish with my sleep (I have a hard time sleeping anywhere other than my bed, am effected my any noise or light, can't sleep with snoring, and will wake up easily and not get back to sleep. If I go, I won't sleep hardly and I can't work that many shifts in a row on no sleep and not kill myself or a patient. I was considering it anyways up to that point. May still if they are desperate).

But I feel like this is just another little thing that is just piling up and up on all the shit we deal with as nurses. They tug on our heart strings, knowing we will help out of the goodness of your heart, that we don't want to abandon patients, even risking our own safety, our patients safety, allowing hospitals to get away with short staffing us and tripling us and making us take on more and more roles outside what we are nurses should be doing (housekeeping, secretary, phlebotomy, patient tech) with less and less resources!?! All while paying us shit, never giving us raises to reflect what we do more and more or matching cost of living, never giving us incentive pay, and guilting us into picking up extra shifts or extra roles to make up the slack!

Maybe I'm just tired on very little sleep and going through post-vacation depression and hurting for everyone affected while happy my area was spared, and getting seriosuly burnt out after 4 years of this shit. Maybe I'm wrong to be mad about no extra pay, that this specific siuation is greater than that and my opinions about my hospital system and my lack of sleep lately are clouding my judgement. Just needed to get it off my chest and see what others feel like.",Yes
Plenty of NPs equally smart as MDs yep. I don't blame you for looking for work life balance as an NP and I'm not questioning that you're probably a good clinician. But in no way in hell should a NP be paid the same as a Physician.,No
"Eh, toileting patients can be really time-consuming, and I don't expect docs to do that. It's also why I'll delegate it if able - I can start a couple of IVs and medicate someone in the time it takes grandma to pee.",No
"I'm an NP and live in Canada where I'm tied to a physician for consultative purposes ONLY if I need help with a diagnosis or treatment plan, which the requirement will be changing very soon because we have enough NPs to take over that role for new graduates. Also, we have the ability to curbside consult specialists just as a GP would. I practice completely independently to the scope of a GP. The GP has no say over my practice and is not responsible for my practice in any manner. But I would never expect to be paid the same amount. Like 75%? I'd be happy with. 

I'm with the physicians on this one. I didn't have to sacrifice my 20s and early 30s for my career. I started off with a good paying job as an RN after graduation. And now as an NP my patient benchmarks and roster are like half what a physician has to see. But that being said, I think the education argument becomes less once an NP has been practising for several years - considering we don't just graduate and stop learning (if you're a good NP). And the education in Canada is pretty rigorous and standardized and there is more regulation coming down the pipeline that will improve it more. 

That being said, I'm relating this to a family physician, not a different specialty. I'd never agree with NP basic education being similar to another specialist without having additional didactic and residency experience equivalent to that specialist's post grad requirements.   

Plus, aren't these NPs required to have supervision by an MD? They are not independent then. You can't expect to be paid independent wages when someone else's license is at stake.

 I also think that GPs are grossly underpaid compared to other specialties. And NPs are also grossly underpaid. But equal? No. ",Yes
">you're not going to solve all my problems.

I appreciate you saying this; but some people absolutely expect this. Not only that, they expect it *now*. 

I have an appointment on my schedule today that says PA CustomerLittle needs to fix my knee RIGHT NOW. Its hard to estimate how many patients really behave this way because we index for negative experience. But I can pretty firmly say this mentality is getting more and more frequent.",Yes
"I was told if the family stands at the bedside praying enough and yelling at the staff this is the likely outcome. Coma--> procedure or 1 dose of ten RIGHT med--> sleep --> happy, healthy patient. But it all depends on the amount of yelling the family does on their advocacy work. ",Yes
"Hypoglycemia is an immediate neurologic injury risk so not treating it to wait 30min to 1hr for thiamine is indeed an obviously bad idea.  But having banana bags in the pyxis and starting it right away can nearly eliminate that malpractice risk too.  Problem is shortages are constant on thiamine IV solutions...  Bigger issue is not thinking of thiamine in a non-alcoholic patient that is malnourished (cancer, eating d/o, major weight loss/GI surgery).",No
"Great question! As it turns out, people tend to respond very well to a slightly science-y explanation of IBS. In lay terms, I talk about the concept of visceral hypersensitivity, and the interactions between the enteric nervous system and other parts of the autonomic nervous system. So for instance, I will describe nerves as having a volume knob that can make sensations louder or quieter in different people or different situations, and talk about changes in pain sensitivity or motility as being no different from other physical manifestations of stress (like heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, etc.). I include the point that physiologically, excitement (positive emotion) and stress (negative emotion) are virtually identical to each other, which is why their kid has terrible symptoms at birthday parties, sleepovers, etc. I talk about the microbiome and how that can impact their tolerance for certain foods (FODMAPs). 

So, IBS patients can be challenging to deal with in a lot of ways, but they really appreciate when you take them seriously and help them understand why they feel terrible so much of the time.",No
I don't get why it's confusing? One has less education and one has more? Like an NP Vs a physician.,No
